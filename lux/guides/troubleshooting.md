# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps resolve common issues encountered during Lux setup and development.

## Setup and Installation Issues

### 1. ASDF and Shell Integration

#### "Command not found: asdf"
1. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew list asdf || brew install asdf
   
   # On Linux
   ls ~/.asdf
   ```

2. **Check Shell Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Identify your shell
   echo $SHELL
   
   # Check if asdf is in your PATH
   echo $PATH | grep asdf
   ```

3. **Fix Shell Integration**:
   ```bash
   # For Zsh
   echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
   echo 'fpath=($HOME/.asdf/completions $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc
   
   # For Bash
   echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

### 2. Elixir/Mix Issues

#### "mix: command not found"
1. **Verify ASDF Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Check if mix is in asdf shims
   ls ~/.asdf/shims/mix
   
   # Try running mix directly from shims
   ~/.asdf/shims/mix --version
   ```

2. **Check Elixir Installation**:
   ```bash
   # List installed versions
   asdf list elixir
   asdf list erlang
   
   # If none installed, install them
   asdf install
   ```

3. **Verify Global Versions**:
   ```bash
   asdf current
   
   # If needed, set global versions
   asdf global erlang latest
   asdf global elixir latest
   ```

### 3. OpenSSL Issues (macOS)

#### Erlang Compilation Fails
1. **Verify OpenSSL Installation**:
   ```bash
   brew list openssl@3
   brew info openssl@3
   ```

2. **Check KERL Configuration**:
   ```bash
   echo $KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS
   
   # Should output something like:
   # --with-ssl=/usr/local/opt/openssl@3
   ```

3. **Fix OpenSSL Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your shell config
   export KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--with-ssl=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)"
   
   # Then reinstall Erlang
   asdf uninstall erlang
   asdf install erlang
   ```

### 4. Permission Issues

#### "Permission denied" Errors
1. **Check Directory Ownership**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.asdf
   
   # Fix ownership if needed
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.asdf
   ```

2. **Check File Permissions**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure proper permissions
   chmod -R 755 ~/.asdf
   ```

### 5. Complete Reset

If you need to start fresh:

1. **Remove ASDF and Tools**:
   ```bash
   # Remove ASDF
   rm -rf ~/.asdf
   
   # Clean shell config (remove asdf-related lines)
   # For zsh:
   sed -i '' '/asdf/d' ~/.zshrc
   # For bash:
   sed -i '' '/asdf/d' ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Reinstall Everything**:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install asdf
   
   # On Linux
   git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.13.1
   
   # Then run setup
   cd /path/to/lux
   make setup
   ```

## Development Issues

### 1. Test Failures

#### Mix Test Failures
1. **Check Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   mix deps.compile
   ```

2. **Clean Build**:
   ```bash
   mix clean
   mix compile --force
   ```

### 2. Python Integration Issues

#### Poetry/Python Problems
1. **Verify Poetry Installation**:
   ```bash
   asdf which poetry
   poetry --version
   ```

2. **Reset Python Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd priv/python
   rm -rf .venv
   poetry env remove --all
   poetry install
   ```
