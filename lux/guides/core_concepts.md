# Core Concepts

Lux is built on several core concepts that work together to create powerful multi-agent systems. This guide provides an overview of these concepts and how they interact.

## Overview

The key components of Lux are:

1. Agents
2. Signals
3. Prisms
4. Beams
5. Lenses
6. Companies

Let's explore each of these in detail.

## Agents

[Detailed Guide](agents.livemd)

Agents are autonomous components that combine intelligence with execution capabilities. They can:

- Interact with Language Models (LLMs)
- Process and respond to signals
- Execute workflows
- Maintain state and memory
- Collaborate with other agents

Key characteristics of agents:
- Unique identifier
- Name and description
- Defined goal or purpose
- LLM configuration
- Optional memory configuration
- Component integration (Prisms, Beams, Lenses)
- Signal handling capabilities

## Signals

[Detailed Guide](signals.livemd)

Signals are the communication protocol in Lux. They provide type-safe, schema-validated message passing between components. A signal consists of:

- Unique identifier
- Schema identifier
- Validated content
- Processing metadata

Signals ensure:
- Type safety
- Schema validation
- Versioning
- Compatibility checking
- Structured communication

## Prisms

[Detailed Guide](prisms.livemd)

Prisms are modular units of functionality that can be composed into workflows. They encapsulate:

- Business logic
- Data transformations
- External integrations
- Validation rules

Key features:
- Input/output schemas
- Handler functions
- Error handling
- Composability
- Testing utilities

## Beams

[Detailed Guide](beams.livemd)

Beams are the orchestration layer of Lux. They compose other components into complex workflows, supporting:

- Sequential execution
- Parallel processing
- Conditional branching
- Error handling
- State management
- Logging and monitoring

A beam consists of:
- Step sequences
- Input/output schemas
- Execution configuration
- Error handling rules
- Parameter passing

## Lenses

[Detailed Guide](lenses.livemd)

Lenses provide structured interaction with external systems and APIs. They handle:

- Authentication
- Data transformation
- Error handling
- Response processing
- Schema validation

Components:
- URL endpoint
- HTTP method configuration
- Authentication setup
- Schema validation
- Response transformation

## Companies

[Detailed Guide](companies.md)

Companies organize agents into collaborative teams. They provide:

- Role management
- Capability registration
- Objective tracking
- Workflow coordination
- Resource allocation

Key concepts:
- CEO and member roles
- Capability definitions
- Objective specifications
- Success criteria
- Execution tracking

## Component Interaction

These components interact in the following ways:

1. **Agent Communication**
   - Agents exchange information via Signals
   - Signals ensure type-safe communication
   - Companies coordinate agent interactions

2. **Workflow Execution**
   - Beams orchestrate complex workflows
   - Prisms provide modular functionality
   - Lenses connect to external systems

3. **State Management**
   - Agents maintain internal state
   - Signals carry state changes
   - Companies track global state

4. **Error Handling**
   - Each component handles errors appropriately
   - Errors propagate through the system
   - Recovery mechanisms exist at multiple levels

## Best Practices

1. **Component Design**
   - Keep components focused and modular
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Document interfaces and behaviors
   - Follow language-specific guidelines

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle errors at appropriate levels
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Implement recovery strategies
   - Log errors with context

3. **Testing**
   - Test components in isolation
   - Test component interactions
   - Use appropriate test types
   - Maintain test coverage

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize cross-component communication
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Consider resource usage
   - Monitor system performance

## Language Support

Lux supports multiple programming languages:

- **Elixir**: Core framework and coordination
- **Python**: ML/AI tasks and data processing
- **Node.js**: Web integration and text processing

Each language has specific guidelines and best practices detailed in:
- [Python Guide](language_support/python.livemd)
- [Node.js Guide](language_support/nodejs.livemd)
- Additional language support coming soon!
