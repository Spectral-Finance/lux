# Multi-Agent Collaboration Plan

## Existing Building Blocks âœ…

1. **Agent Infrastructure**
   - [x] Basic Agent structure with configurable components (prisms, beams, lenses)
   - [x] Agent Supervisor for managing multiple agent processes
   - [x] Memory system for individual agents
   - [x] Agent reflection capabilities for self-awareness and decision making

2. **Communication Foundation**
   - [x] Signal system for point-to-point message passing
   - [x] Basic signal routing infrastructure
   - [x] Signal delivery status tracking and notifications
   - [x] Chat handling prism for processing messages
   - [x] Basic collaboration protocols defined (`:ask`, `:tell`, `:delegate`, `:request_review`)

3. **Agent Management**
   - [x] Dynamic agent creation and supervision
   - [x] Agent lifecycle management (start/stop)
   - [x] Individual agent state management
   - [x] Central hub for discovering available agents (AgentHub)
   - [x] Agent capability advertisement system
   - [x] Agent status tracking (busy, available, offline)

## Implementation Priority

1. Enhanced Communication (High Priority)
   - Core functionality needed for reliable agent interaction
   - Focus on point-to-point signal delivery
   - Signal archival system for persistence and analysis

2. Collaboration Protocols Implementation (High Priority)
   - Enables structured interaction patterns
   - Builds on communication system

3. Team Formation and Management (Medium Priority)
   - Organizes agents into effective teams
   - Depends on discovery and communication

4. Coordination and Orchestration (Medium Priority)
   - Optimizes team performance
   - Requires basic collaboration features

5. Shared Knowledge and Resources (Medium Priority)
   - Enhances team effectiveness
   - Builds on team management
   - Includes signal archival system

6. Monitoring and Debugging (Low Priority)
   - Improves system observability
   - Can be added after core functionality

7. Security and Safety (Ongoing)
   - Should be considered throughout implementation
   - Can be enhanced iteratively
